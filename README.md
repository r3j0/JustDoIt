# üìù JUST DO IT

![main](img/logo-1.png) 

Schedule automatic placement calendar that allows you to manage schedules and to-do tasks in chronological order. Instead of thinking about what to do, let's actually solve it in time! That's why we named this project "JUST DO IT".

The page was implemented using bootstrap and JavaScript. The service is available locally in [https://r3j0.github.io/JustDoIt](https://r3j0.github.io/JustDoIt). 

## Repository
- index.html
- js/calendar.js : JavaScript file for calendar features.
- js/todolist.js : JavaScript file for todolist features.
- js/assignTask.js : JavaScript file that includes the ability to automatically place things to do.

## Usage
